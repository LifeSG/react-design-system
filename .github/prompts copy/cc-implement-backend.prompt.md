Follow the instructions in #file:./cc-implement-task.prompt.md in the specific context of a backend feature.

Consider the following additional points:

-   Ensure that the backend implementation adheres to best practices in API design and security.
-   Make sure to validate and sanitize all inputs. Get clarification from the user if needed.
-   Use the backend frameworks and libraries as specified in the repository documentation. Prefer existing services when possible.
-   If required, clarify any specific security and authorization requirements with the user before proceeding.
-   Determine if unit tests, API tests, integration tests and E2E tests are used in the repository and follow the testing strategy accordingly.
