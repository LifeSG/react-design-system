Follow the instructions in #file:./cc-implement-task.prompt.md in the specific context of a frontend feature.

Consider the following additional points:

-   Ensure that the frontend implementation adheres to best practices in UI/UX design.
-   Make sure accessibility standards are met. Get clarification from the user if needed.
-   Use the frontend frameworks and design component libraries as specified in the repository documentation. Prefer existing components when possible.
-   If required, clarify responsive design requirements for different screen sizes with the user before proceeding.
-   Determine if UI tests or E2E tests are used in the repository and follow the testing strategy accordingly.
