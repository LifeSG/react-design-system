# Layout

The layout components help limit elements based on the user's screen size.

These components uses the styles from the **Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)**. [Read more](https://www.designsystem.tech.gov.sg/docs/container/) to find out.

There are 5 main components you can make use of:

-   `Section` - this is the equivalent of `sgds-section` class.
-   `Container` - this is the equivalent of `sgds-container` class.
-   `Content` - this is a combination of `Section` and `Container` to provide a fuss free usage.

## Usage

Based on the **SGDS**, it recommends to use the `Section` and `Container` together to achieve the correct responsive layout.

<ExampleComponent />

<br />

Our `Layout` components follows the same behaviour. Here is how you can use it.

```tsx
import { Layout } from "react-lifesg-design-system";

<Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Container>Example layout</Layout.Container>
</Layout.Section>;
```

However we understand that having to remember to use two different components could be cumbersome.
As such, for a more fuss free approach, we have the `Content` component that composes of `Section` and `Container`. To use it, simply do this:

```tsx
import { Layout } from "react-lifesg-design-system";

<Layout.Content>Example layout</Layout.Content>;
```

## Style Specifications

The `Section` component has a built in `1.5rem` horizontal padding for screen widths of `768px` and below, as part of our design system guidelines.
To overwrite that style, you will simply need to overwrite the css style:

```css
padding-left: 0 !important;
padding-right: 0 !important;
```

## Amending the styling

You can simply amend the style of the Layout components as such

### With `styled-components`

```tsx
const StyledContainer = styled(Layout.Container)`
    background: red;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
`;
```

### With CSS

```tsx
<Layout.Container className="my-custom-class">Example layout</Layout.Container>
```

**NOTE**: For the `Content` component, amending the styling will affect the `Container` component rather than the `Section` component. If you require more customized styling, we suggest
composing the components yourself.

## Passing Ref

Layout components also support the passing of the `ref` property. Here is how to do it.

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";

const sectionRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

// Render function
return (
    <Layout.Section ref={sectionRef}>
        <YourComponent />
    </Layout.Section>
);
```
