# Breadcrumb

## Overview

Displays the current page location in a hierarchy of pages.

```tsx
import { Breadcrumb } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/breadcrumb";
```

> **Note**: The last item is always designed to be unclickable as it is deemed to be the current location that
> the user is on

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbStories.Default} />

## Customising the fade color

> Note that the fade effect appears only if the `Breadcrumbs` are compressed and
> becomes scrollable

<br />

## Different fade colors

You can specify different fade colors on both ends of the `Breadcrumb` or even
on one side.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbStories.DifferentFadeColors} />

## Component API

<PropsTable />
