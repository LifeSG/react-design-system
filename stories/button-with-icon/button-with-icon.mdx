The primary call to action component.

```tsx
import { ButtonWithIcon } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/button-with-icon";
```

The `ButtonWithIcon` component comes in 2 sizes, a default and small size.

<Canvas of={ButtonWithIconStories.Default} />

You can also specify the icon to be on the right side.
