<Meta of={CardStories} />

<Title>Card</Title>

<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component that has rounded corners and box shadow and can have any contents.
Can be used stand-alone or as part of other components (e.g. Popover, Tooltip).

```tsx
import { Card } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/card";
```

<Canvas of={CardStories.Default} />

<Heading3>Custom Content</Heading3>

Other than a `string`, the `Card` also accepts a `JSX.Element` as its `children`.
The child `JSX.Element` is unaltered and is simply wrapped by the `Card`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CustomContent} />

<Heading3>Customising the style</Heading3>

You can customize/override the style of the `Card` component by extending it:

```tsx
import { Card } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/card";
import styled from "styled-components";

export const StyledCard = styled(Card)`
    border-radius: 4px;
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
    max-width: 30rem;
    /* Other CSS properties... */
`;
```

This component also inherits the [HTMLDivAttributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDivElement)
