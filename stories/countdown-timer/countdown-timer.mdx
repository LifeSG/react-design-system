# Countdown Timer

## Overview

Displays a countdown timer.

```tsx
import { CountdownTimer } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/countdown-timer";
```

<Canvas of={CountdownTimerStories.Default} />

## Timestamp

A timestamp for the end of the countdown can be used instead of `timer` (timestamp takes precedence if both are provided).

<Canvas of={CountdownTimerStories.Timestamp} />

## Scroll behaviour

The countdown timer is fixed to the top when scrolled out of view. By default it is aligned right, relative to its original position. It can also be aligned left.

> Note: Due to the storybook environment, the scroll detection may not be accurate.
> [View this canvas in a new tab](./iframe.html?args=&id=modules-countdowntimer--scroll-behaviour&viewMode=story) for best results.

<Canvas of={CountdownTimerStories.ScrollBehaviour} />

## Advanced positioning

The position can also be customised via the offset props.

> Note: Due to the storybook environment, the scroll detection may not be accurate.
> View [this canvas in a new tab](./iframe.html?args=&id=modules-countdowntimer--scroll-behaviour&viewMode=story) for best results.

<Canvas of={CountdownTimerStories.CustomOffset} />
