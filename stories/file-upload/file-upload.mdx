<Title>FileUpload</Title>

<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component that allows for uploading files.

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/file-upload";
```

<Canvas of={FileUploadStories.Default} />

<Heading3>Error display</Heading3>

Each file item comes with an error display to indicate that the upload has failed.

<Canvas of={FileUploadStories.WithErrorDisplay} />

<Heading3>Loading indicator</Heading3>

The component also has the ability to render a loading indicator for file
uploads. However this will require the user to manage the progress themselves.

> The source code implementation is meant for simulation purposes and should
> not be used entirely as reference for the exact implementation

<Canvas of={FileUploadStories.WithLoadingIndicator} />

<Heading3>Editable file items</Heading3>

The component also enables you to add a description to the file item. Note that
this does not alter the file in any way and is up to the discretion of the user
of the component to decide what to do with it.

> **Note**: Currently only image file uploads have this feature.

<Canvas of={FileUploadStories.EditableFileItems} />

<Heading3>Sortable file items</Heading3>

The component also enables you to perform a drag sort on the items to give you
the flexibility to reorder items after uploading them.

> Note: Sorting is only enabled if there are no items in edit mode
