import { Canvas, Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";

<Meta of={FilterStories} />

<Title>Filter</Title>

<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

Displays widgets under collapsible panels to filter data results.

```tsx
import { Filter } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/filter";
```

<Canvas of={FilterStories.Default} />

<Heading3>Configuring filter item</Heading3>

Each item can be configured with `collapsible`, `showDivider` and `showMobileDivider` props.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.ConfiguringFilterItem} />

<Heading3>Expanded state</Heading3>

By default, the expanded state is handled by the component. For advanced use cases, the filter item can be used as a controlled component.

> Note: this example works in desktop only

<Canvas of={FilterStories.HandlingExpandedState} />

<Heading3>Minimising content</Heading3>

For longer filter items, content can be minimised with the `minimisable` prop.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.Minimised} />

<Heading3>Accessing mode</Heading3>

If you need the current visible mode, you may pass in a render prop as a child of `Filter` or `Filter.Item`.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.AccessingMode} />

<Heading3>Floating content</Heading3>

If some child elements are positioned absolutely, content may be clipped if they exceed the parent's boundaries.
For such scenarios, you may increase the height of the container by adding some padding.

In the example below, extra padding is applied when the dropdown list is expanded.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.WithFloatingContent} />

<Heading3>Displaying filter in fullscreen</Heading3>

Some filters may need to rendered as a fullscreen page while editing. A display component is provided for this purpose and can be combined with the `Overlay` component.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.DisplayFilterInFullscreen} />

<PropsTable />
