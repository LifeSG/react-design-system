# Filter

## Overview

Displays widgets under collapsible panels to filter data results.

```tsx
import { Filter } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/filter";
```

<Canvas of={FilterStories.Default} />

## Configuring filter item

Each item can be configured with `collapsible`, `showDivider` and `showMobileDivider` props.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.ConfiguringFilterItem} />

## Expanded state

By default, the expanded state is handled by the component. For advanced use cases, the filter item can be used as a controlled component.

> Note: this example works in desktop only

<Canvas of={FilterStories.HandlingExpandedState} />

## Minimising content

For longer filter items, content can be minimised with the `minimisable` prop.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.Minimised} />

## Accessing mode

If you need the current visible mode, you may pass in a render prop as a child of `Filter` or `Filter.Item`.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.AccessingMode} />

## Floating content

If some child elements are positioned absolutely, content may be clipped if they exceed the parent's boundaries.
It is recommended to use a smart positioning library such as [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) to render such content.
If you are unable to do so, an alternative is to increase the height of the container by adding some padding.

In the example below, extra padding is applied when the item is expanded.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.WithFloatingContent} />

## Displaying filter in fullscreen

Some filters may need to rendered as a fullscreen page while editing. A display component is provided for this purpose and can be combined with the `Overlay` component.

<Canvas of={FilterStories.DisplayFilterInFullscreen} />
