# Form.CustomField

## Overview

Allows for a custom form element to be specified, and still have the label and
error message.

```tsx
import { Form } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/form";
```

<Canvas of={FormCustomFieldStories.Default} />

## Accessibility

The component injects the following props into the form element:

-   `aria-describedby`
-   `aria-invalid`
-   `aria-labelledby`

The form element can be associated with the subtitle and error message by
forwarding them accordingly.
