# Form.MaskedInput

## Overview

An enhanced field that allows a user to enter a response that is masked on blur.

```tsx
import { Form } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/form";
```

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.Default} />

## Loading display

In some cases where the unmasking requires an asynchronous process, you might want to display
a loading indicator for the users. As such this component comes with a loading display. Here is
an example of how you can set things up.

> Note: This only applies if the component is in `readOnly` mode.
> You may also have to handle the masking and unmasking manually to ensure the value changes
> are being reflected accurately

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.LoadingDisplay} />

## Masking

You are able to specify the range of index to mask or unmask, the regex to mask or customize the masking logic by passing in a maskTransformer.

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.Masking} />

## Customizations

You are able to make customizations to the mask icon active and inactive color, as well as the mask character.

## Rendering in grid layouts

You can also specify [ColDiv's](/docs/core-layout-coldiv--docs)
column props to span across the specified columns in grid layouts.

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.RenderingInGridLayout} />

## Using the field as a standalone

In the case that you require the input mask field as a standalone, you can do this.

```tsx
import { MaskedInput } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/masked-input";
```

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.StandaloneUsage} />
