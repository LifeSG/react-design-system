<Meta of={FormMaskedInputStories} />

<Title>Form.MaskedInput</Title>

<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

An enhanced field that allows a user to enter a response that is masked on blur.

```tsx
import { Form } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/form";
```

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.Default} />

<Heading3>Loading display</Heading3>

In some cases where the unmasking requires an asynchronous process, you might want to display
a loading indicator for the users. As such this component comes with a loading display. Here is
an example of how you can set things up.

> Note: You will have to handle the masking and unmasking manually to ensure the value changes
> are being reflected accurately

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.LoadingDisplay} />

<Heading3>Masking</Heading3>

You are able to specify the range of index to mask or unmask, the regex to mask or customize the masking logic by passing in a maskTransformer.

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.Masking} />

<Heading3>Customizations</Heading3>

You are able to make customizations to the mask icon active and inactive color, as well as the mask character.

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.WithCustomizations} />

<Heading3>Rendering in grid layouts</Heading3>

You can also specify [ColDiv's](/docs/getting-started-layout-column-divs--docs)
column props to span across the specified columns in grid layouts.

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.RenderingInGridLayout} />

<Heading3>Using the field as a standalone</Heading3>

In the case that you require the input mask field as a standalone, you can do this.

```tsx
import { MaskedInput } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/masked-input";
```

<Canvas of={FormMaskedInputStories.StandaloneUsage} />
