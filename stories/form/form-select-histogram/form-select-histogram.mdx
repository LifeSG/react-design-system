# Form.SelectHistogram

## Overview

A field that provides a set of options shown as a histogram for a user to select.

```tsx
import { Form } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/form";
```

<Canvas of={FormSelectHistogramStories.Default} />

## With labels

<Canvas of={FormSelectHistogramStories.WithLabels} />

## Empty bins

If there are no results across any of the bins, you may specify a custom display.

<Canvas of={FormSelectHistogramStories.EmptyBins} />

## Rendering in grid layouts

You can also specify [ColDiv's](/docs/core-layout-coldiv--docs)
column props to span across the specified columns in grid layouts.

<Canvas of={FormSelectHistogramStories.RenderingInGridLayout} />

## Z-index conflicts

The dropdown uses z-index to display above elements. It is `Modal` and
`Overlay`-aware by default; when rendered as a child of either component, it
will automatically adjust its z-index to remain visible.

If you still encounter z-index issues, try setting a custom `dropdownZIndex`.

## Using the field as a standalone

In the case that you require the select histogram field as a standalone, you can do this.

```tsx
import { SelectHistogram } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/select-histogram";
```

<Canvas of={FormSelectHistogramStories.StandaloneUsage} />
