# Form.Select

## Overview

A field that provides a set of options for a user to select.

```tsx
import { Form } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/form";
```

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.Select} />

## With custom list item display

You are able to customise the display of the dropdown list items as well as the selected option.

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.WithCustomListItemDisplay} />

## With search capabilities

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.WithSearch} />

## With Virtualisation

The dropdown list displays large data sets using virtualised rendering to optimise performance.

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.Virtualisation} />

## With custom call to action at the bottom of dropdown list

You are also able to specify a custom call to action component at the bottom
of the list.

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.WithCustomCallToAction} />

## Label truncation

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.LabelTruncation} />

## Load state display

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.LoadState} />

## Rendering in grid layouts

You can also specify [ColDiv's](/docs/core-layout-coldiv--docs)
column props to span across the specified columns in grid layouts.

## Small variant

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.SmallVariant} />

## Z-index conflicts

The dropdown uses z-index to display above elements. It is `Modal` and
`Overlay`-aware by default; when rendered as a child of either component, it
will automatically adjust its z-index to remain visible.

If you still encounter z-index issues, try setting a custom `dropdownZIndex`.

## Using the field as a standalone

In the case that you require the select field as a standalone, you can do this.

```tsx
import { InputSelect } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/input-select";
```

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.StandaloneUsage} />
