Install the LifeSG Design System package.

```
npm i @lifesg/react-design-system
```

The module requires some custom css for certain components to work properly. As the module does not ship with css, you will need to add this into the `head` of your html file.

```tsx
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    type="text/css"
    href="https://assets.life.gov.sg/react-design-system/v2/css/main.css"
/>
```

Or if you are importing to an existing css file

```css
@import url("https://assets.life.gov.sg/react-design-system/v2/css/main.css");
```

## Setting up the theme

If you are intending to make use of the themes, you will need [**Styled Components**](https://styled-components.com/docs).

Styled components provide us with the `ThemeProvider` which you could make use of.

```tsx
// app.tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";
import { BaseTheme } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/theme";
import { Component } from "./index";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <ThemeProvider theme={BaseTheme}>
            <Component />
        </ThemeProvider>
    );
};

export default App;
```

For more information on the usage of themes, you can visit our [documentation](/docs/getting-started-themes--docs) about it.
