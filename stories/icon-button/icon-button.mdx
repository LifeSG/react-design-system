# Icon Button

## Overview

A call to action component with an icon in it.

```tsx
import { IconButton } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/icon-button";
```

<Canvas of={IconButtonStories.Default} />

## Variations

The `IconButton` component comes in 3 sizes, a large, small and default size.

<Canvas of={IconButtonStories.Variations} />

## Using custom components

You can also pass in custom components to the `IconButton`. In this example, we will pass in an image.

<Canvas of={IconButtonStories.CustomComponents} />

## Accessibility

By default, a disabled `<IconButton>` cannot receive focus or events. In certain
modes across screen readers, it is excluded from the focus order, which can make
detecting its presence more difficult.

To keep the disabled IconButton focusable, specify `focusableWhenDisabled`. The
`onClick` callback is not invoked when the user attempts to click on the IconButton.

There are some caveats:

-   Other event listeners such as `onKeyDown`, `onTouchStart` remain triggered
-   `onClick` events still bubble to ancestors

<Canvas of={IconButtonStories.FocusableWhenDisabled} />

For best results, check the `disabled` state in your application.

```tsx
const Page = () => {
    const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState(false);

    return (
        <div
            onClick={() => {
                if (disabled) return;
                // application logic here
            }}
        >
            <IconButton disabled={disabled}>
                <LockIcon />
            </IconButton>
        </div>
    );
};
```
