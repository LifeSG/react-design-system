# Layout.ColDiv

## Overview

A div that conforms to the grid layout of `Layout.Container`.

```tsx
import { Layout } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/layout";
```

## Anatomy

The Column Divs allows specifying the column widths for each viewport based on
the [breakpoint tokens](/docs/foundations-breakpoint-introduction--docs). **By
default, the component will only take up 1 column in the grid regardless of the
viewport.**

You can set columns widths at different breakpoints to achieve a responsive
layout. A width also applies to larger viewports until overridden by another
width on a larger breakpoint. For example, `xxsCols={4}` and `mdCols={8}` occupy
4 columns for the xxs-sm breakpoints, then 8 columns for the md-xxl breakpoints.

## Specifying ranges

You can also specify the start and end [column lines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid_Lines) for more control over the positioning of items.
