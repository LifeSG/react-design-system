# ModalV2

## Overview

A window or pop up that displays over other page contents and provides information or actions
that a user can perform.

```tsx
import { ModalV2 } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/modal-v2";
```

There are 4 components that can be used.

Correct usage of these components will ensure the modal will have
the correct padding and accessibility behaviours.

-   `ModalV2` represents the base modal overlay. This is a **mandatory component** to be used.
-   `ModalV2.Card` represents the dialog box that comes with a rounded border.
    -   It must be rendered as a child of `ModalV2`
    -   Will only render children that are `ModalV2.Content` or `ModalV2.CloseButton`
    -   Stylable with `customStyle` prop
-   `ModalV2.Content` represents the content to be displayed within ModalV2.Card.
    -   It must be rendered as a child of ModalV2.Card
    -   Stylable with `customStyle` prop
-   `ModalV2.CloseButton` represents the close button to close the modal.
    -   Optional, but if used, it must be rendered as a child of ModalV2.Card
    -   Stylable with `customStyle` prop

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.Default} />

## Without close button

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.WithoutCloseButton} />

## Custom content

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.CustomContent} />

## Stacked modals

In some cases, you would require a stacked modal layout. Here is how you can construct it.

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.StackedModals} />

## Scrollable modals

If the content of your modal is longer than the screen size, use scrollable modals.

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.ScrollableModals} />

## Component API

Both components also inherit the [HTMLDivElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDivElement).

<PropsTable />

## Component style tokens

<StyleTokensTable />
