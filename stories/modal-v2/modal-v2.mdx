# Modal

## Overview

A window or pop up that displays over other page contents and provides information or actions
that a user can perform.

```tsx
import { ModalV2 } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/modal-v2";
```

There are 2 components that can be used:

-   `Modal` represents the base modal overlay. This is a **mandatory component** to be used.
-   `Modal.Box` represents the dialog box that comes with a rounded border and a close button.

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.Default} />

## Custom content

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.CustomContent} />

## Stacked modals

In some cases, you would require a stacked modal layout. Here is how you can construct it.

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.StackedModals} />

## Scrollable modals

If the content of your modal is longer than the screen size, use scrollable modals.

<Canvas of={ModalV2Stories.ScrollableModals} />

## Modal.Box

This component holds the dialog box.

You're recommended to apply this spacing around your content to avoid overlap with the close button:

| Viewport       | Vertical | Horizontal |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Desktop/tablet | 4rem     | 4rem       |
| Mobile         | 4rem     | 1.25rem    |

> **Note**: This component does not come with a scrollable container and it is the
> onus on the child element to possess the scroll behaviour

```tsx
<Modal.Box onClose={closeModal}>
    <ScrollableContent>
        <span>I am a Modal</span>
    </ScrollableContent>
</Modal.Box>
```

## Component API

Both components also inherit the [HTMLDivElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDivElement).

<PropsTable />

## Component style tokens

<StyleTokensTable />
