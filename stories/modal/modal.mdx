import { Canvas, Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";
import { Heading3, Secondary, Title } from "../storybook-common";
import * as ModalStories from "./modal.stories";

<Meta of={ModalStories} />

<Title>Modal</Title>

<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A window or pop up that displays over other page contents and provides information or actions
that a user can perform.

```tsx
import { Modal } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/modal";
```

There are 2 components that can be used:

-   `Modal` represents the base modal overlay. This is a **mandatory component** to be used.
-   `Modal.Box` represents the dialog box that comes with a rounded border and a close button.

> **Note**: Due to the storybook environment, the background of the overlay is scrollable. However in actual, it should not be the case

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Default} />

<Heading3>Custom content</Heading3>

<Canvas of={ModalStories.CustomContent} />

<Heading3>Stacked modals</Heading3>

In some cases, you would require a stacked modal layout. Here is how you can construct it.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.StackedModals} />

<Heading3>Modal.Box</Heading3>

This component holds the dialog box.

> **Note**: This component does not come with a scrollable container and it is the
> onus on the child element to possess the scroll behaviour

```tsx
<Modal.Box onClose={closeModal}>
    <ScrollableContent>
        <span>I am a Modal</span>
    </ScrollableContent>
</Modal.Box>
```

Both components also inherit the [HTMLDivElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDivElement).

<PropsTable />
