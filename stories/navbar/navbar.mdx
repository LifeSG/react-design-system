# Navbar

## Overview

A component that displays navigation links, action buttons and a brand at the top of the web page.

```tsx
import { Navbar } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/navbar";
```

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.Default} />

## Anatomy

The Navbar comes with 3 main components:

-   Masthead
-   Brand
-   Navigation links

In the mobile viewports, the navigation links are presented in a drawer and is triggered by clicking on the menu icon button.

> **NOTE**: The `Navbar` drawer dismissal animation takes **550ms**. If you are intending to perform scrolling effects in page after a selection in the drawer, you can add a timeout before performing the scrolling

<br />

## Usage examples

## Single action button

This is a common use case among web apps where it requires a Logout button on the navigation bar.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.SingleActionButton} />

## Multiple action buttons

> **Note**: In the mobile view, the `download` action button will always be positioned last

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.MultipleActionButtons} />

## Custom component action buttons

You can also choose to render a custom component of your choice as an action button.

## Uncollapsible action buttons

You can set an action button to be uncollapsible, so it remains visible in the navigation bar on mobile viewports.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.UncollapsibleActionButtons} />

## Custom component items

You can also choose to render a custom component of your choice as a navigation bar item.

## Prevent dismissal of drawer on specific actions

In this example, we are preventing the drawer's dismissal on the brand logo click. We'll make use of
the `blockDrawerDismissalMethods` prop to do just that.

> **Note**: You will need to view this in a mobile or tablet viewport to see the interaction

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.PreventDrawerDismissal} />

## Sub menu

A sub menu is shown if the selected nav item has sublinks.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.SubMenu} />

## Secondary branding

In this example, a co-brand is displayed next to the primary brand.

## Hidden masthead

In this example, the masthead is hidden.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.HiddenMasthead} />

## Stretched layout

In this example, the content of the navbar (and masthead, if applicable) is
stretched to the full width of the screen with a fixed padding.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.StretchedLayout} />

## Hide branding

When the branding elements are hidden, navigation items will be aligned to the left on desktop.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.HiddenBranding} />

## Hide link indicator

In this example, the link indicator for selected link items are hidden.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.HiddenLinkIndicator} />

## With Avatar

The Navbar can be used in conjunction with the Avatar component to display user information, by adding it as an uncollapsible action button.

<Canvas of={NavbarStories.WithAvatar} />

## Troubleshooting

> The component also uses a custom script. Should you encounter a content security
> policy error, do whitelist this url in the `script-src` directive.
