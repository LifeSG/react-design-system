<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component to handle the entry of the one-time password (OTP) for multi-factored
authentication methods.

```tsx
import { OtpInput } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/otp-input";
```

<Canvas of={OtpInputStories.Default} />

<Heading3>With an error message</Heading3>

<Canvas of={OtpInputStories.WithErrorMessage} />

<Heading3>With a custom action button</Heading3>

You can also customise the action button's props to suit your needs.

<Heading4>Usage of in-built countdown</Heading4>

In this instance, you will need to handle the label when a countdown is ongoing.
There are callback functions like `onCooldownStart` and `onCooldownEnd` to assist
you with it.

> You can use `setInterval` to handle the countdown display

<Canvas of={OtpInputStories.WithCustomActionButton} />

<Heading4>Usage of custom countdown mechanism</Heading4>

In this instance, you will need to handle the countdown calculation
and rendering entirely on your own. In this example, we will just
use a simple `setTimeout` to handle the change in label.

> You can use `setInterval` to handle the countdown display

<Canvas of={OtpInputStories.WithCustomActionButtonSelfHandle} />
