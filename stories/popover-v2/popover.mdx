# PopoverV2

## Overview

A component which appears when hovering or clicking on a target element and displays information about a certain element in the page.

This module contains:

-   PopoverV2 - the presentational component
-   PopoverTrigger - a utility component that handles triggering of the popover
-   [PopoverInline](/docs/modules-popoverv2-popoverinline--docs) - a utility component that displays a text or icon-based trigger

```tsx
import { PopoverTrigger } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/popover-v2";
```

<Canvas of={PopoverStories.HoverInteraction} />

### Behaviour

**Appearance**

-   The `Popover` component automatically positions itself based on the amount of space available. It will always attempt to display itself at the preferred position by default
-   The `Popover` appears as a modal in mobile viewports

**Keyboard support**

The trigger should be included in the page's tab sequence. This way, users who
navigate via keyboard can open the popover with `Space`/`Enter`. On open, focus
will move to the popover. Press `Escape` to dismiss the popover.

The example below illustrates the positioning behaviour when viewed on desktop.

## Default styling

The component comes with basic styling for commonly used markup such as `<strong>` or `<a>`.

## Customisation

You can opt out of the default appearance to display custom content such as menus and dialogs.

<Heading3>Z-index conflicts</Heading3>

The popover uses z-index to display above elements. It may end up rendering
below another element with a higher z-index.

The popover is `Modal` and `Overlay`-aware by default; when rendered as a child
of either component, it will automatically adjust its z-index to remain visible.
The story below illustrates the default behaviour.

If you still encounter z-index issues, try setting a custom `zIndex` or
`rootNode`.
