<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component which appears when hovering or clicking on a target element and displays information about a certain element in the page.

> **It is recommended to use this if you have more content to display within the popover bubble. If the content is short, consider using the [Tooltip](/docs/modules-tooltip--docs) instead.**

```tsx
import { withPopover } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/popover";
```

<Canvas of={PopoverStories.Default} />

<Heading4>Appearance information</Heading4>

-   The `Popover` component automatically positions itself based on the amount of space available. It will always attempt to display itself on top of the trigger component by default
-   The `Popover` appears as a modal in mobile viewports

{/* USAGE */}

<Heading3>Usage</Heading3>

We recommend using the `withPopover` higher order component (HOC) to construct the component. Here
is how you can do it.

<Heading4>Step 1: Create the trigger component</Heading4>

```tsx
import { Text } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/text";

const Trigger = () => (
    <CustomDiv>
        <Text.Body>Hover me</Text.Body>
    </CustomDiv>
);
```

<Heading4>Step 2: Use the HOC function to create a HOC</Heading4>

```tsx
const PopoverHOC = withPopover(Trigger, {
    content: "This is the popover content",
    trigger: "hover",
});
```

<Heading4>Step 3: Compose the component with the HOC</Heading4>

```tsx
export const PopoverHOCExample = () => {
    return (
        <Container>
            <PopoverHOC />
        </Container>
    );
};
```

> Take note that when using a HOC, it is important to
> **ensure that the declaration of the HOC is not within the functional component**.
> Doing so would cause certain display animations to not function correctly.

```tsx
/** Wrong **/

export const WrongExample = () => {
    const PopoverHOC = withPopover(Trigger, {
        content: "This is the popover content",
        trigger: "hover",
    }); // You should not do this

    return (
        <Container>
            <PopoverHOC />
        </Container>
    );
};

/** Correct **/

const PopoverHOC = withPopover(Trigger, {
    content: "This is the popover content",
    trigger: "hover",
});

export const CorrectExample = () => {
    return (
        <Container>
            <PopoverHOC />
        </Container>
    );
};
```

{/* USING AS A COMPONENT */}

<Heading3>Using as a component</Heading3>

You also have the freedom to construct the `Popover` as a separate component from its trigger.

```tsx
import { Popover } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/popover";
```

<Canvas of={PopoverStories.UsingAsAComponent} />

<Secondary>Component API</Secondary>

```tsx
withPopover(component: JSX.Element, options: PopoverHOCOptionsProps): (props: PopoverHOCProps) => JSX.Element
```

The derived HOC component has its own set of props that are typed under `PopoverHOCProps`

<PropsTable />
