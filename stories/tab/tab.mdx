<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

Used to organise content into multiple panes. Users can toggle between the different tabs to view different categories of information.

```tsx
import { Tab } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/tab";
```

<Canvas of={TabStories.Default} />

<Secondary>Anatomy</Secondary>

The `Tab` component comprises of 2 components:

-   `Tab` which is the main component that will come with the selectors and controls the contents to be displayed
-   `Tab.Item` is the component that will be used to wrap the contents of each tab item

<br />

<Secondary>Handling longer tab labels</Secondary>

It is important to note that on tablet and mobile viewports, anything more than 20 characters will be truncated
to ensure that all tab items are accessible within a few scrolls. Here is an example:

<Canvas of={TabStories.LongerLabels} />

<Secondary>Controlled mode</Secondary>

While the `Tab` handles the rendering logic, upon each tab click, automatically, it also
offers the ability to control the behaviour entirely yourself. You can set the
`tabItemRenderMode` to `"controlled"` and you will have full control of how the tab items
are rendered. Here is a simple example where we control the state on our own.

<Canvas of={TabStories.ControlledMode} />
