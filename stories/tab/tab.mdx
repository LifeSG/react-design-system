<Title>Tab</Title>

<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

Used to organise content into multiple panes. Users can toggle between the different tabs to view different categories of information.

```tsx
import { Tab } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/tab";
```

<Canvas of={TabStories.Default} />

<Secondary>Anatomy</Secondary>

The `Tab` component comprises of 2 components:

-   `Tab` which is the main component that will come with the selectors and controls the contents to be displayed
-   `Tab.Item` is the component that will be used to wrap the contents of each tab item

<br />

<Secondary>Handling longer tab labels</Secondary>

It is important to note that on tablet and mobile viewports, anything more than 20 characters will be truncated
to ensure that all tab items are accessible within a few scrolls. Here is an example:

<Canvas of={TabStories.LongerLabels} />

<Secondary>Controlled mode</Secondary>

While the `Tab` handles the rendering logic automatically upon a tab link click,
it also offers the ability to control the behaviour entirely yourself. You will
just have to specify the `currentActive` prop and you will have full control of
how the tab items are rendered. Here is a simple example where we control the
state on our own.

<Canvas of={TabStories.ControlledMode} />

<Secondary>Full width bottom border</Secondary>

If you want the bottom border to extend to the full container, use the `fullWidthIndicatorLine` prop

<Canvas of={TabStories.FullWidthIndicatorLine} />

<Secondary>Override tab width and Center tab label</Secondary>

If you want to specify the width of a tab, use the `overrideTabWidth` prop (eg: "50%", "100px").
If you want to center the label of a tab within the specified width, use the `centerTabLabel` prop.

<Canvas of={TabStories.OverrideTabWidthAndCenterTabLabel} />
