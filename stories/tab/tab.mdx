# Tab

## Overview

Used to organise content into multiple panes. Users can toggle between the different tabs to view different categories of information.

```tsx
import { Tab } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/tab";
```

<Canvas of={TabStories.Default} />

## Anatomy

The `Tab` component comprises of 2 components:

-   `Tab` which is the main component that will come with the selectors and controls the contents to be displayed
-   `Tab.Item` is the component that will be used to wrap the contents of each tab item

<br />

## Handling longer tab labels

It is important to note that on tablet and mobile viewports, anything more than 20 characters will be truncated
to ensure that all tab items are accessible within a few scrolls. Here is an example:

<Canvas of={TabStories.LongerLabels} />

## Controlled mode

While the `Tab` handles the rendering logic automatically upon a tab link click,
it also offers the ability to control the behaviour entirely yourself. You will
just have to specify the `currentActive` prop and you will have full control of
how the tab items are rendered. Here is a simple example where we control the
state on our own.

<Canvas of={TabStories.ControlledMode} />
