# TextList

## Overview

Renders a group of related contents within a list format.

```tsx
import { TextList } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/text-list";
```

## Unordered List

This list is used when order does not matter and it does not follow a numbering
system for each list item.

You can also choose the bullet type from the selection. Types include `disc`,
`circle`, `square`, `none`.

## Ordered List

This list is used when order matters and it follows a numbering system for each
list item.

You can also customize counter type and the counter separator as well. Counter
types include `lower-alpha`, `decimal`, `lower-roman`.

## Advanced Usage

Under some circumstances, you might want to customise the counter to suit your
use case.

You can do so by overriding the default styling.

```tsx
export const CustomOrderedList = styled(V2_TextList.Ol)`
    margin-left: 2rem;

    li {
        margin-left: 1rem;
    }

    li:before {
        content: counters(list, ".") ".";
        left: -3rem;
    }
`;
```
