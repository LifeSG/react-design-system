# Introduction

The Dcube Design System is built upon a core group of design tokens and components,
with first-class support for theming.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are variables that store values used for styling. Examples of such
values are:

-   Colours e.g. `#ff0000`, `rgb(0,0,0)`
-   Dimensions e.g. `16px`, `1rem`
-   Font specifications e.g. `Open Sans`

A design token can be an alias of another token, or even made up of multiple tokens.

The design system offers the following types of tokens:

-   Colour
-   Typography
-   Breakpoint
-   Shadow
-   Border radius
-   Z-index
-   Motion

## Themes

A theme is a collection of design tokens. You can customise certain visual
properties of components by configuring the theme in your project.
