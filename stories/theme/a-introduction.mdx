# Introduction

The Dcube Design System is built upon a core group of design tokens and components,
with first-class support for theming.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are variables that store values used for styling. Examples of such
values are:

-   Colours e.g. `#ff0000`, `rgb(0,0,0)`
-   Dimensions e.g. `16px`, `1rem`
-   Font specifications e.g. `Open Sans`

A design token can be an alias of another token, or even made up of multiple tokens.

The design system offers the following types of tokens:

-   Colour
-   Typography
-   Breakpoint
-   Shadow
-   Border radius
-   Z-index
-   Motion

## Themes

A theme is a collection of design tokens. You can customise certain visual
properties of components by configuring the theme in your project.

Learn more about themes [here](/docs/foundations-themes-introduction--docs).

## General usage

### With styled components

```tsx
import { Colour } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/theme";
import styled, { css } from "styled-components";

const SomeComponent = styled.div`
    background: ${Colour["background-error"]};
`;

// If you extract the props, remember to wrap nested interpolations with the css helper
const AnotherComponent = styled.div`
    ${(props) => {
        return css`
            background: ${Colour["background-error"]};
        `;
    }}
`;
```

### As a constant

If you require the token as a constant value, you could do this:

```tsx
import { Colour, LifeSGTheme } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/theme";
import { useTheme } from "styled-components";

const colour = Colour["text"]({ theme: LifeSGTheme });
```

### In React components

If you require the token as a constant value based on the current theme, you
could do this:

```tsx
import { Colour, LifeSGTheme } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/theme";
import { useTheme } from "styled-components";

const Component = () => {
    const theme = useTheme();
    const colour = Colour["text"]({ theme });
};
```
