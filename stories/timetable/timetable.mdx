<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component that displays a timetable to view a schedule for a specific day

```tsx
import { TimeTable } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/timetable";
```

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.Default} />

<Secondary>TimeTable with navigation arrows</Secondary>
The timetable is using the `DateNavigator` component when `onRightArrowClick` and
`onLeftArrowClick` props are passed in.

You may use `minDate` and `maxDate` to specify
how far in the future or past the timetable can be viewed until.

_(In this example,
the user can only view the timetable 2 days before today and 2 days after today)_

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.TimeTableWithNavigation} />

<Secondary>Lazy Load</Secondary>

Clicking onto the refresh icon on the top left-hand corner will trigger a refresh on the component level.

Lazy load is also enabled if `onPage` callback is passed in

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.TimeTableWithLazyLoad} />

<Secondary>Customisable popover width and padding</Secondary>

You may choose to customise the padding and width of the popover for filled and disabled cells through `filledCellPopoverSize` and `blockedCellPopoverSize` respectively

Do note that if the custom popover trigger is set to click, it will override the behaviour with the onClick callback for each cell

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.TimeTableWithStyledPopovers} />

<Secondary>TimeTable with no popover content</Secondary>

If there's no `blockedCellHoverContent` or `filledBlockClickContent` provided, the popover will not appear

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.TimeTableWithNoPopoverContent} />

<Secondary>No results found</Secondary>

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.TimeTableWithEmptyContent} />
