<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component that displays a timetable to view a schedule for a specific day.
This supports slots in 15 minute intervals only.

```tsx
import { TimeTable } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/timetable";
```

> This component auto generates blocked cells based on the difference in
> start/end time between each row and the overall timetable, and disabled cells
> when there are missing gaps between each row cell's start/end time.

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.Default} />

<Secondary>Lazy loading</Secondary>

Optional `onRefresh` and `totalRecords` props can also be passed in to show the
total count and for refreshing results.

This is especially useful when lazy loading is enabled through the `onPage`
callback.

<Canvas of={TimeTableStories.LazyLoading} />

<Secondary>Custom popovers</Secondary>

Custom popovers can be added onto row header names and row cells. There is also
the flexibility to have custom popovers on auto generated blocked cells through
the `outOfRangeCellPopover` prop.

However, auto generated disabled cells will not have any popover interaction.

Do note that if the custom popover trigger is set to click, it could conflict
with the onClick callback for each cell.

<Secondary>No results found</Secondary>

`emptyContentMessage` can be passed in to control what description to show when there are no
results to display.
