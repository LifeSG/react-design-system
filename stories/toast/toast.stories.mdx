<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

<code>Toast</code> are used to inform users of updates or changes to system status.
Communicating with users and providing immediate feedback are important for building
trust. While notifications are an effective method of communicating with users, they
are disruptive and should be used sparingly.

```tsx
import { Toast } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/toast";
```

<!--Non Auto Dismiss-->

Toast should appear one at a time and they are dismissible and animate into
a screen by displaying near the content that returns its feedback.

There is a four type of status:-

<code>Successful - Green</code>
<br />
<code>Warning - Orange</code>
<br />
<code>Error - Red</code>
<br />
<code>Info - Blue</code>
<br />

non-auto dismiss if the context of the banner is longer or required userâ€™s
action.
