## Common Patterns

## Additional inputs if selected

A common use case is to request follow-up inputs from the user only when the
option is selected. These inputs are shown in a collapsible sub-section. When
expanded, errors are shown inline. When collapsed, an error alert is shown.

<Canvas of={ToggleExampleStories.AdditionalInputs} />

## Dynamic option

A common use case is for users to add their own options to a list. The user can
also remove this custom option afterwards. This variant cannot be collapsed.

<Canvas of={ToggleExampleStories.DynamicOption} />

## Interactive sublabel

By default, clicking on the sublabel will activate the `Toggle`. If you require interactive content such as links,
you may opt out of this behaviour as such:

<Canvas of={ToggleExampleStories.InteractiveSublabel} />
