# Accessibility Guidelines

When building radio or checkbox groups with the toggle component, follow these best practices to ensure
a smooth experience for all users.

## Building radio or checkbox groups with toggles

Wrap the toggles in a `<fieldset>` and provide a `<legend>` for the group label.
Assistive technologies will announce the legend before each option.

Additionally, ensure that all radio-type toggles in the group share the same name attribute.
This allows screen readers to recognize them as a single group and announce their position within it.

## Connect error text using ARIA attributes

Use `aria-describedby` on the toggle to reference any associated helper or error message elements by their IDs.
For error messages, you can combine this with `aria-invalid="true"` to indicate an invalid state.
