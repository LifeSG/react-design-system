<DocInfo>
  **Which module to use?**<br /><br />

**Scenario 1: Text content**

If you are rendering text content, such as headings, paragraphs and links, use
this Typography component as it comes with additional capabilities to help you
lay out text.<br /><br />

**Scenario 2: Parent container**

If you are rendering a container that contains text children but does not need
to be a text element itself, apply the [font design
tokens](/docs/foundations-font-introduction--docs) directly.<br /><br />

**Scenario 3: HTML children**

If you are rendering a container that can contain arbitrary HTML markup, use the
[Markup component](/docs/core-markup--docs).

## Combining styles

### Inline text

You can nest text within text using the `inline` prop. The nested text is
rendered as a `span` element.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.InlineText} />

### Inline link

You can include links within a set of text. Links are inline by default.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.InlineLink} />

### Font weight

You can include different weights within a set of text using the `weight` and
`inline` props.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.MixedFontWeights} />

## Paragraph specification

You can include paragraph spacing between text blocks by specifying the
`paragraph` prop.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Paragraphs} />

## Max lines

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.MaxLines} />

## External links

If a link leads to an external site, it is recommended to specify the `external`
prop, which displays an indicator.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.ExternalLink} />
