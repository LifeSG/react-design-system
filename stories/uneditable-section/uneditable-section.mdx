<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component that renders uneditable data fields and information.

```tsx
import { UneditableSection } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/uneditable-section";
```

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.Default} />

<Heading3>With custom content</Heading3>

You are able to compose custom content on the top and bottom of the details to suit
your requirements.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.WithCustomContent} />

<Heading3>Composing from scratch</Heading3>

For added flexibility, you are able to compose the entire section from scratch
without using the `items` prop. This is useful if you have additional components
to render in each of the uneditable items.

To do so, you can make use of the `UneditableSection.ItemSection` and `UneditableSection.Item`
to render the details at any position you intend.
