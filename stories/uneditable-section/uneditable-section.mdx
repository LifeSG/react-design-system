<Secondary>Overview</Secondary>

A component that renders uneditable data fields and information.

```tsx
import { UneditableSection } from "@lifesg/react-design-system/uneditable-section";
```

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.Default} />

<Heading3>With no background</Heading3>

The `UneditableSection` comes default with a grey background. However you have the
choice to render it transparent as well.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.NoBackground} />

<Heading3>With masked values</Heading3>

You can render values that are masked, with various customisations. Here is an
example of the different variations.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.WithMaskedItems} />

You can also handle the masked or unmasked values on your own. To do so, you will
need to intercept the `onMask` and `onUnmask` callbacks.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.ControlledMaskUnmask} />

<Heading3>With loading indicator</Heading3>

In some cases, the mask or unmask action requires an API call or an action that has
some loading time. The component also supports such instances.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.MaskUnmaskWithLoading} />

<Heading3>With error display</Heading3>

In the event that there is an error, a display will appear with the ability to
try again.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.MaskUnmaskWithError} />

<Heading3>With alert display</Heading3>

Sometimes you might have some extra information which you would like to inform users of.
As such you can make use of the `Alert` to render those information.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.MaskUnmaskWithAlert} />

<Heading3>With custom content</Heading3>

You are able to compose custom content on the top and bottom of the details to suit
your requirements.

<Canvas of={UneditableSectionStories.WithCustomContent} />

<Heading3>Composing from scratch</Heading3>

For added flexibility, you are able to compose the entire section from scratch
without using the `items` prop. This is useful if you have additional components
to render in each of the uneditable items.

To do so, you can make use of the `UneditableSection.ItemSection` and `UneditableSection.Item`
to render the details at any position you intend.
